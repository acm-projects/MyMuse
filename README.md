# MVP
  - Create user profiles and add friends
  - Sends users daily notifications to post their song of the day and show users their friends' songs of the day
  - Can add messages to other people's song of the day
  - Tracks users' song of the day to give them a breakdown after every month of their most played genres and artists, as well as generate a monthly color       based on the songs they listened to

# Stretch Goals
  - Show album picture with song upload
  - Favorite a song that someone has uploaded if you like the song
